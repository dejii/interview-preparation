"""
Youâ€™re given a read only array of n integers. 
Find out if any integer occurs more than n/3 times in the array in linear time and constant additional space.

If so, return the integer. If not, return -1.

If there are multiple solutions, return any one.

Example :

Input : [1 2 3 1 1]
Output : 1 
1 occurs 3 times which is more than 5/3 times.
